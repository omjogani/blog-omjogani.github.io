### Hi there 👋 My name is Om Jogani!

I'm a Software Engineer living in the beautiful city of [Surat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat), also known as the Diamond City. I hold a B.Tech degree 🧑‍🎓 in Computer Engineering 🖥️ from [Dharmsinh Desai University](https://ddu.ac.in). Currently, I have been working as Software Craftsperson at [Incubyte](https://incubyte.co).

I am passionate about Computer Engineering because it allows me to work from any corner of a room while helping thousands of people worldwide. I enjoy exploring the inner workings of technologies to understand their granular details. Through this blog, I love to write and share my learnings with fellow tech enthusiasts.

I have published two mobile 📱 applications that help students excel in their studies and learn English from Gujarati. I have gained insights into students' mindsets and identified their needs to make learning enjoyable, which I have incorporated into my applications. You can find them here [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Om+Jogani&hl=en&gl=US).
